    <h2>Workflow</h2>
        <p>A Git workflow is a suggestion/recipe for how a team will use Git to achieve working on a project in a consistent way with a with more functionality and productivity.</p>
        <p>With the option of creating single branches for indevidules to work on the main project and then discus gives any project that is carried out in git is insently given a error checking and development area before any merges to the master project.</p>
    <h2>Staging</h2>
        <p>The main command to stage a file is "git add filename" this will place the file and any changes in to the staging area.</p><p>Once the files are in the staging area you can then commit them for evey change you make with a coment but it is advised to try and keep your commits to every five change.</p>
        <h3>Extra Staging Commands</h3>
            <p>git add --all this will add all files within the directory to the staging area.</p>
            <p>git remote add takes two arrguments, your remote repos name and the url of the github repository that you are adding it to.</p>
            <p>git add "directory path": this will stage a specific directory or file, you need to have a file within the folder as git will not allow an empty folder to be push with out a file, for tracking logs.<p>
            <p>git rm filename is used to remove files or changes that are in the staging area.</p>
            <p>git rm --chached filename will remove the file from the staging area only, this may need -r after rm for folders.</p>
